# Team Delta (ùõø) - GTFS Application

An application designed to efficiently view and edit General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files.

## Progress Reports
### Lab 7

Our team selected option ALL: We implemented all of the features (option 1, option 2, and option 3) proposed in the lab, and then some after that.

* Features 2 and 5 were already implemented.
* Mason and Grant focused on implementing feature 8.
* Grant also did some general code cleanup.
* Michael focused on implementing option 3.
* Colton implemented some additional methods that we thought might be useful.
